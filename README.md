First off letâ€™s start the machine up and wait 5 mins.
	
  Enumeration:
==================================
I always starts my enumeration with nmap.

22:SSH

80:HTTP web server
==================================
	FTP login:
==================================
So anonymous login looks cool let's login with anonymous credentials

We got a file. Let's look what is that

So it's all about web server let's look at it..
==================================
	WEB:
==================================
We have just default apache page, so let's use some tools

As you can see there is a directory called "hotelbx". Let's check it!

It seems the page is using "Hotel Reservation System". Let's check if there was an exploit to use
==================================
	SQL INJECTION:
==================================
Cool let's try to use it

and it works.. Let's try to dump the data with sqlmap

We got 2 hashes Let's try to crack them

==================================
	USER & ROOT
==================================

So first things first let's get the user flag.
